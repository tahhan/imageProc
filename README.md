#imageProc
A simple Image Processing program with GUI using Python and PyQt4

##image processing operations implemented
###histogram modification

- Stretch Histogram

- Shrink Histogram

- Slide Histogram
	
	- left

	- right

- Histogram Equalization

###Mapping Equations

- Negative

###Local (Mask) Operations

- Mean Local Filtering

- Median Local Filtering

###Segmentation

- Sobel Edge Detector

##next step
###Project milestones

- Colored Images.

- Add more image processing operations.

- Frequency Domain Operations.

###Code Enhancements

- all classes are reusable.

- performance tuning.

basically implementing most of [Image Processing Operator Worksheets](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/wksheets.htm)

##Building imageProc
###dependencies

- Python 2.6.6

- sip 4.13.2

- PyQt 4.9.1

- NumPy 1.7.0

###[SIP](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download/)
> SIP is a tool that makes it very easy to create Python bindings for C and C++ libraries. It was originally developed to create PyQt, the Python bindings for the Qt toolkit, but can be used to create bindings for any C or C++ library.

###[PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download/)
> PyQt is a set of Python bindings for Nokia's Qt application framework and runs on all platforms supported by Qt including Windows, MacOS/X and Linux.

###[NumPy](http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy/Linux)
> NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
